# learning
This repo is created to serve as the basics for my understanding and launch of my personal website. 

I am planning to expand my technical knowledge gained earlier in my career, which was 12 years ago. I know the basic of OOP, having worked with C and C++ programming langauges briefly. 

My current plan is the learn the basics of back-end, systems design and slowly understand AI & Data concepts. I also want to expand my skills in SQL, scripting and prompt engineering. 

As an initial kick-off project, my plan is to launch personal website and push the contents in social media platform, forming a basic understanding of DevOps and software development.
